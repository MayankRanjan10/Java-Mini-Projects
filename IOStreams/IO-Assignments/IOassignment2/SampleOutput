Abstract:
In present Day scenario there are lots of threats for the Army personals, so our project is to prepare an unmanned robot to ensure the safety. Basically it is designed for the surveillance in the remote location. It can detect the bomb as well as send an alert of the bomb location using the GPS module to the specified person. At the time of surveillance in the remote areas, if there is a suspicious activity by an intruder then it immediately captures the face and sends it to the specified person and it can live stream the video so that we can track the further activities of the intruder. Along with this, it can be used in the forest for the surveillance as well as to detect the forest fires so that there will be no harm to the nature.
